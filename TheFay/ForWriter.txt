When formating story the lines should be built like this (Plot; option 1; Option 2; Destination1; Destination2)

The char [;] Splits the story in those five catagories. 

You may even use the [;] char to make paragraphs but make sure to have at least 5 for the (Plot; option 1; Option 2; Destination1; Destination2)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The word "Game Over" Spelt excatly like that will end the game. You must give it its own split or the program wont read it.
You will not need (option 1; Option 2; Destination1; Destination2) for a Game Over.

Ex: Plot; Game Over 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"You Win" Text does the same as Game Over but "You Win" instead.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Each line is a new page

ex:

Page 1:
Page 2:
Page 3:
